# KIN

A shared hub for your music collective. A calm place where the group's music lives, remembers itself, and reflects what people collectively return to.

## What is KIN?

KIN is a shared external memory for a music group. It holds all of your songs, mixes, and recordings in one place — and quietly surfaces what the group keeps coming back to.

No project management. No mandatory process. Just a space that works even when nobody's paying attention to it.

## What it does

- **All your music in one place** — songs and their audio artefacts, organised together
- **Shows what matters** — tracks what the group listens to and surfaces the pieces attracting attention
- **Lightweight feedback** — leave comments on songs or specific artefacts without the overhead of a thread
- **Collections** — group songs around an idea, a setlist, or a release, shared or personal
- **External sharing** — share any artefact with someone outside the group via a private link
- **Dropbox backup** — mirrors everything to Dropbox for durable, independent access

## How music is organised

Each **song** represents a single creative intent or variation. If two versions differ meaningfully in composition, tempo, lyrics, or feel, they are separate songs.

Under a song, **artefacts** form a tree representing the creative evolution over time:

- Each song has a **root artefact** (the initial recording or mix)
- New artefacts are created by attaching them to existing ones — branches naturally represent revisions, alternatives, or parallel exploration
- Artefacts are untyped — meaning emerges from position in the tree, recency, and naming

One artefact may be designated as the **current artefact**, representing the mix the group considers authoritative for listening.

## Design philosophy

KIN is built for a group where coordination is expensive and sustained attention is unreliable. Everything about it follows from that:

- Nothing breaks if you ignore it for months
- Features guide behaviour — they don't enforce it
- The system reflects what you do, it doesn't tell you what to do
- Simple and calm beats clever and busy
