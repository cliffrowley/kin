# KIN

A shared hub for your music collective. A calm place where the group's music lives, remembers itself, and reflects what people collectively return to.

## What is KIN?

KIN is a shared external memory for a music group. It holds all of your songs, mixes, and recordings in one place — and quietly surfaces what the group keeps coming back to.

No project management. No mandatory process. Just a space that works even when nobody's paying attention to it.

## What it does

- **All your music in one place** — songs, mixes, contributions, and masters, organised together
- **Shows what matters** — tracks what the group listens to and surfaces the pieces attracting attention
- **Lightweight feedback** — leave comments on specific mixes or contributions without the overhead of a thread
- **Collections** — group songs around an idea, a setlist, or a release, shared or personal
- **External sharing** — share any artefact with someone outside the group via a private link
- **Dropbox backup** — mirrors everything to Dropbox for durable, independent access

## How music is organised

Each **song** is an anchor for related creative work. Under a song, you'll find **artefacts**:

- **Mixes** — listenable versions of the song at a point in time
- **Contributions** — isolated parts or stems supporting a mix
- **Masters** — release-ready renders

Artefacts can be linked to each other to show what was built from what. A song can have a **main mix** representing the current shared intent.

## Design philosophy

KIN is built for a group where coordination is expensive and sustained attention is unreliable. Everything about it follows from that:

- Nothing breaks if you ignore it for months
- Features guide behaviour — they don't enforce it
- The system reflects what you do, it doesn't tell you what to do
- Simple and calm beats clever and busy
